Generator:
 Generate food webs with different numbers of trophic levels, and different overall specialization
 Allow Cross-trophic level predation (Only be done by generalist)
 Ex.
  To generate two similar food webs
  To generate two dissimiliar food webs

IO:
 Standard IO
 Input:
  Float (W)idth: How generalized can a species be
  Float (D)epth: How many trophics can the food web have
  Float (N)umber of the Species
  Float (S)tandard Deviation of the data set (width)
  Float (P)ossibility of the Cross-trophic level predation

Basic Structure:
 Directed Graph

Steps:
 Divide trophic level first
 Connect Predation
